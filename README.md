# Onboarding Package for Undergraduate Research Assistants

<img width="200" src="./BITSS_logo_horizontal.png"><img width="200" src="./CEGA_logo.png">

__Welcome to BITSS!__ As a URAP, your tasks will mainly be related to two of our main projects:
  1. Open Policy Analysis ([OPA](https://www.bitss.org/opa/))
  2. Accelerating Computational Reproducibility in Economics ([ACRE](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/)).  

Within the OPA project you will be part of one of three tracks:

1. *Data Visualization for Public Policy (DVPP)* – develop interactive data visualizations in the form of web apps using R Shiny;

2. *Data Science for Public Policy (DSPP)* – translate econometric and policy analyses into R code; or

3. *Public Policy Research and Outreach (PPRO)* – identify policy analyses for potential application of OPA principles and support the development of common standards for OPA.

Each track will meet weekly to present their progress and discuss next steps. Regardless of your track each week all URAPs must follow the same logistics/workflow.

### Logistics/workflow
- __Task assignment:__ At the beginnig of the week, you will be assigned tasks via a task list in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/issues/30). When beginning to work on a task, move it to the 'Work in progress' section, then later move it to the 'Completed' section and mark the task as complete after reviewing it in the weekly meeting.  
- __Tracking your progress:__ Each week, you are expected to complete/attempt your assigned tasks and update your report of progress, located in a folder at [this repository](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress) _(See folders 05 and after for format examples)_. **The deadline for submitting your weekly report of progress is Friday 5pm.** Reports will be reviewed during the weekend to assign further tasks.

- **Unavailability due to midterm overload:** each URAP is allowed to up to 2 tokens per semester to excuse themsleves from working on a given week. You are only required announce the use of that token one week on advance (in your weekly report).

### Fall Calendar
 - Week 1 (9/21): Introductory materials for OPA and ACRE.
 - Week 2 (9/28): Instroductory tasks for each track.
 - Week 3 - 10 (23/30): Track-specific tasks.
 - Week 11 (11/30): Wrap-up report (summary, tutorials, next steps).
