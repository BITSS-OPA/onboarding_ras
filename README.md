# Onboarding Package for Undergraduate Research Assistants

<img width="200" src="./BITSS_logo_horizontal.png"><img width="200" src="./CEGA_logo.png">

__Welcome to BITSS!__ As a URAP, your tasks will mainly be related to Open Policy Analysis ([OPA](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA)) or the Accelerating Computational Reproducibility in Economics project ([ACRE](https://github.com/BITSS/ACRE)).  

### Logistics/workflow
- __Task assignment:__ You will be assigned tasks via a task list in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/issues/30). When beginning to work on a task, move it to the 'Work in progress' section, then later move it to the 'Completed' section and mark the task as complete after reviewing it in the weekly meeting.  
- __Tracking your progress:__ Each week, you are expected to complete/attempt your assigned tasks and update your report of progress, located in a folder at [this repository](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress) _(See folders 05 and after for format examples)_.
